# Causal_Analysis
Causal Analysis of Customer Churn using DeepLearning

In this experiment a framework proposes using the Deep Feed Forward Neural
Network DFF NN algorithm accompanied by a sequential
pattern mining method on a massive financial dataset with
high-dimensional sparse data for the classification task. We
also propose a causality analysis system for predicting the
probability of causes that lead to customer churn.
