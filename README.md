Causal Analysis of Customer Churn using DeepLearning

In this experiment a framework proposed for Causal Analysis of Customer Churn by using DeepLearning algorithm and DoWhy packages, using the Deep Feed Forward Neural
Network DFF NN algorithm accompanied by a sequential pattern mining method on a massive financial dataset with high-dimensional sparse data for the classification task. We
also propose a causality analysis system for predicting the probability of causes that lead to customer churn.
